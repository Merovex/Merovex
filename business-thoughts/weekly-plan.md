# Weekly Plan Template

Inspired by Marc Andreson. The graphic shows 3 different activities.
* Todo - This is a preview of the upcoming week, updated as you go.
* Status - Weekly Status report

## Prioritization

P0..P2 [How to Prioritize During Development](https://www.bluelabellabs.com/blog/a-primer-on-prioritization/)
* P0 - Must - Cannot release without; something that you have to do the instant it comes up; drop everything and worry about it
* P1 - Should - Won't hold up a release, but really want; something that you can do on the second day
* P2 - Could /Won't - Nice, not must; something that can wait until P0-P1 are done.

## Project Boards

* General
   * Todo - containing all ‘must do’ (P0, P1) commitments that need to be prioritized.
   * Today - Tasks we need to get done today
   * Watch - containing everything that has a blocker stopping you from doing it right now, but that you need to keep tabs on.
   * Later - containing  everything that you might want to do ‘later’ but isn’t a priority (P2).

## Thoughts:

1. Open to ALL.
1. Sections: Meetings, Projects, Team
   - Meetings, list all meetings with brief summary
   - Projects, 
2. Meetings are Issues
   - Actions identified by issue ID & title in the notes 
   - "#xx - WHO - DUE - WHAT"
2. Actions Issues
   - Tag `waiting` if someone owes you
   - If need status, etc. add as TODO
   - Use a Template
3. Todos, Can just be project cards.
