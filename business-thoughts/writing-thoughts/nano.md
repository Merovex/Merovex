## Writing Thoughts

### Your novel is:

* A cast of compelling characters with strong wants/needs/desire/motivation
* A story with drama, romance, conflict, humor and heart-warming scenes
* Told in front of a richly textured and memorable setting that tickles many
senses
* Either neatly outlined and organized or else just primed enough for exploratory discovery writing
* Simplified enough to complete the first draft within the bounds of November yet filled with the promise of unfolding subplots and engaging side characters
* Constructed with rising and falling plot structure tension with something like the 7 point

### Your Characters are:

People who appear internally consistent and yet are capable of surprise. Characters should have four crucial elements:

* a driving need, desire, ambition or goal, since desire creates conflict
* a secret (like a hidden trait/inclination or an incident from the past)---secrets inform
us of what the character has to lose.
* a contradiction that yields enigma, mystery and surprise
* and vulnerability, which draws in the reader.. 

### Your Character’s journey involves:

Key moments and emotional incidents to explore for your character:

* moment of greatest fear
* moment of greatest courage
* moment of greatest sorrow
* moment of greatest joy
* worst failure
* moment of deepest shame
* moment of most profound guilt
* moment of most redemptive forgiveness

### Your plot is:

the "what" plus the "why" of a story, and how multiple whats and whys fit together in a larger chain.

Your plot should:
* Create curiosity and raise lingering questions.
* Show cohesion
* Obey their own internal logic.
* Avoid cliche and create surprise.
* Give readers something worth the investment

### Your character's motivations are:

* Influenced by their past actions, the people and events who shaped them, and the people and forces who are acting now upon them.
* The driving force behind their actions throughout the story
* A part in how they interact with other characters
* Something that’s allowed to change as circumstances develop 

## Editing

Editing is:

* Fixing plot holes
* Questioning if all scenes are needed
* Questioning if all characters are needed
* Transforming passive verbs
* Reducing word count
* Killing your darlings
* Removing redundancy
* Receiving critiques
* The word loss diet
* Re-outlining
* Reviewing your story as if someone else wrote it---someone you don’t like
* Axing adverbs
* Updating telling to showing
* Ending chapters on cliff hangers
* Replacing negative with positive

### Your Editing Checklist is:

Basic Principles:

1. Do things that make you want to come back and edit some more (You cannot edit an entire 50,000+ word novel in one sitting, so you need to set it up so that you're willing to come back again and again and again.)
2. You don't have to fix everything on one pass.
3. Do things that make your novel better with each pass.
4. Keep working until you're happy with the finished result.
5. Think about getting outside input
