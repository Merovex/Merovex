The Best Keto Cheesy Bread
Serves: 8 servings (~4 breadsticks per serving)

## Ingredients:

### Dough

* 2 1/4 tsp dry instant yeast
* 1 tbsp white sugar (yeast will eat this and it will not affect you! It is necessary, you can use 2 tsp instead if you'd like but I can't guarantee the same rise for this large amount of dough)
* 1 1/4 cup Vital Wheat Gluten, 154g
* 1 cup almond flour, 112g
* 1/2 cup oat fiber, 96g (If you are having trouble finding it, Amazon now sells it under the brand KATE NATURALS as well as IHerb and some bulk food stores)
* 1/4 cup coconut flour, 30g
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp xanthan gum
* 1 tsp each; salt, basil, oregano
* 1/2 tsp of each rosemary, thyme, garlic powder and onion powder
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 7 tbsp olive oil, 105ml
* 1 tbsp sour cream, room temperature
* 2 1/4 cup warm water

### Toppings

* 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp garlic butter (or crushed garlic + regular butter), 60g
* 2 cups fresh mozzarella, shredded, 8oz
* 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp fresh parmesan, grated, ~50g

additional fresh or dry basil

## Directions:

1. In a large bowl, whisk together all of your dry ingredients up to and including pepper.
1. Next, add your sour cream, olive oil and water. (I like to add my water a bit at a time but 2 1/4 cups should be a perfect amount, this dough absorbs a lot more liquid than you'd think!)
1. Mix the dough using a spoon and then begin to work it together with your hands.
1. To knead to dough, you can either knead it by hand on a clean flat surface for ~10min OR knead it with a dough hook in a stand mixer for ~7-8min.
1. Next form your dough into a ball shape and place it in a greased bowl. Cover it with Saran Wrap or tin foil and let it sit somewhere warm for 1-2 hours OR until doubled in size. (I like to put mine in a previously heated microwave or oven that's warm but not hot OR let it sit near my gas fireplace).
1. While you are waiting for your dough to rise, this is a great time to shred your mozzarella and parmesan.
1. Once the dough has doubled in size, pre-heat your oven to 425*F.
1. Dump the dough out onto a piece of parchment paper and separate the dough into the amount you want to use and be sure to store the rest (as I mentioned above).
1. Roll the piece of dough between two pieces of parchment paper into a thin large oval or rectangular shape.
1. Brush or rub the dough with your garlic butter.
1. Sprinkle your shredded mozzarella and parmesan along with the basil over the top and place in the oven to bake.
1. Bake the keto cheese breadsticks at 425* F for ~15-20 min or until the crust is quite crisp and the cheese, bubbly and brown.
1. Slice into strips and serve warm with a side of garlic dip or marinara sauce. Enjoy your Keto Cheesy Bread!
